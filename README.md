## User Story

```md
AS A payroll manager
I WANT AN employee payroll tracker
SO THAT I can see my employees' payroll data and properly budget for the company
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```md
GIVEN an employee payroll tracker
WHEN I click the "Add employee" button
THEN I am presented with a series of prompts asking for first name, last name, and salary
WHEN I finish adding an employee
THEN I am prompted to continue or cancel
WHEN I choose to continue
THEN I am prompted to add a new employee
WHEN I choose to cancel
THEN my employee data is displayed on the page sorted alphabetically by last name, and the console shows computed and aggregated data
```

## Usage

When the user selects the 'Add Employee' button, they will be prompted to enter the employee's name and salary. They will also be asked if they would like to add another employee. If they do not wish to add another, they can select 'Cancel'. The entered employee information will then be displayed on the page.
